To achieve your goal of scanning Red Hat system vulnerabilities with Ansible, inserting them into a GoLang REST API, and visualizing the results on a web application, the task will involve several components. I'll break this down step by step and provide sample code for each part.

Key Components:
Ansible Playbook: To scan Red Hat systems for vulnerabilities.
GoLang REST API: To receive and store the vulnerability data.
Web Application: To visualize the vulnerabilities, filtered by severity.
Assumptions:
The Red Hat system is using yum or dnf for package management.
The GoLang API stores vulnerabilities in a simple structure like an in-memory data store or a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
The web application uses a basic frontend (React, Vue, or even simple HTML/JS) to display the vulnerabilities.
Step 1: Ansible Playbook to Scan Red Hat System Vulnerabilities
Ansible can be used to scan the Red Hat system for vulnerabilities by querying package versions and checking for any known security vulnerabilities. For Red Hat-based systems, you can use the yum or dnf modules along with Red Hat's Security Data.

Here is a simple Ansible playbook that gathers installed package data and checks for security advisories:

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Scan Red Hat system for vulnerabilities
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Get list of installed packages
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: installed
      register: installed_packages

    - name: Fetch available security updates
      command: yum updateinfo list security
      register: security_updates
      changed_when: false

    - name: Save security vulnerabilities to a file
      copy:
        content: "{{ security_updates.stdout }}"
        dest: "/tmp/security_vulnerabilities.txt"
      delegate_to: localhost

    - name: Parse security vulnerabilities and create JSON output
      set_fact:
        vulnerabilities: "{{ security_updates.stdout_lines | map('regex_replace', '.*\\[([A-Za-z0-9_]+)\\].*\\s(.*)', '\\1: \\2') | list }}"

    - name: Save vulnerabilities as JSON
      copy:
        content: "{{ vulnerabilities | to_json }}"
        dest: "/tmp/vulnerabilities.json"
      delegate_to: localhost

    - name: Upload vulnerabilities to GoLang API
      uri:
        url: "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities"
        method: POST
        body: "{{ vulnerabilities | to_json }}"
        headers:
          Content-Type: "application/json"
        status_code: 200
Explanation:
Get list of installed packages: This retrieves the list of installed packages on the Red Hat system.
Fetch available security updates: This fetches the list of security updates from the Red Hat system using the yum command.
Save vulnerabilities to a file: This saves the output to a local file.
Parse vulnerabilities: This parses the security updates to extract vulnerability information.
Upload vulnerabilities to GoLang API: This POSTs the vulnerabilities as JSON to the GoLang REST API.
Step 2: GoLang REST API to Receive Vulnerabilities
Now, let's build a simple GoLang REST API to receive and store the vulnerability data sent by the Ansible playbook.

Install Dependencies
Install GoLang (if not already installed).
Install the gorilla/mux package for routing (you can also use Go's native net/http package).
bash
Copy code
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
GoLang Code
go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "sync"
)

type Vulnerability struct {
    Package  string `json:"package"`
    Severity string `json:"severity"`
}

var vulnerabilities []Vulnerability
var mu sync.Mutex

func getVulnerabilities(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    mu.Lock()
    defer mu.Unlock()

    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(vulnerabilities)
}

func addVulnerability(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var newVulnerabilities []Vulnerability
    err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&newVulnerabilities)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    mu.Lock()
    vulnerabilities = append(vulnerabilities, newVulnerabilities...)
    mu.Unlock()

    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Vulnerabilities added successfully")
}

func main() {
    r := mux.NewRouter()
    r.HandleFunc("/vulnerabilities", getVulnerabilities).Methods("GET")
    r.HandleFunc("/vulnerabilities", addVulnerability).Methods("POST")

    fmt.Println("Server running on http://localhost:8080")
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r))
}
Explanation:
Vulnerability struct: Defines the structure of a vulnerability with fields like Package and Severity.
addVulnerability function: This function receives the vulnerabilities as a POST request and adds them to the vulnerabilities slice.
getVulnerabilities function: This function serves the vulnerabilities as a JSON array when accessed via a GET request.
Server: The Go server listens on port 8080 and provides two endpoints:
POST /vulnerabilities: To add vulnerabilities.
GET /vulnerabilities: To retrieve the vulnerabilities.
Step 3: Visualizing the Data in a Web Application
For simplicity, let's use a basic web interface with HTML/JS to consume the data from the API.

HTML/JS Frontend
Create a file index.html:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Vulnerability Dashboard</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        table {
            width: 100%;
            border-collapse: collapse;
        }
        th, td {
            padding: 8px 12px;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            text-align: left;
        }
        th {
            background-color: #f4f4f4;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Vulnerability Dashboard</h1>
    <table id="vulnerabilitiesTable">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Package</th>
                <th>Severity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <!-- Vulnerabilities will be dynamically populated here -->
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <script>
        async function fetchVulnerabilities() {
            const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities');
            const vulnerabilities = await response.json();

            const tableBody = document.querySelector('#vulnerabilitiesTable tbody');
            tableBody.innerHTML = ''; // Clear existing rows

            vulnerabilities.forEach(vul => {
                const row = document.createElement('tr');
                row.innerHTML = `<td>${vul.package}</td><td>${vul.severity}</td>`;
                tableBody.appendChild(row);
            });
        }

        fetchVulnerabilities();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Explanation:
HTML structure: It contains a table to display the vulnerabilities.
JavaScript: The script fetches vulnerabilities from the GoLang API (GET /vulnerabilities) and dynamically populates the table with the data.
Step 4: Run the System
Start the GoLang REST API:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
This will start the Go server on http://localhost:8080.

Run the Ansible Playbook to scan the Red Hat system and send vulnerabilities to the Go API:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook scan_vulnerabilities.yml
Open the Web Application:

Open the index.html in a browser to view the vulnerabilities in a table format.
Conclusion:
Ansible Playbook scans the Red Hat system for vulnerabilities.
GoLang REST API stores and serves vulnerability data.
Web Frontend dynamically displays the data in a table.
This provides a simple and automated way to scan Red Hat vulnerabilities, store them, and visualize them in a web app. You can extend this by adding user authentication, pagination, or severity-based filtering on the frontend.
